# K-Space Visualization

This repository contains a MATLAB script to visualize k-space and image reconstruction in MRI.

## Description

This script creates a phantom image and computes its 2D Fourier Transform to obtain k-space data. It then extracts the magnitude and phase from the k-space data and performs an inverse 2D Fourier Transform to reconstruct the image. The original phantom, magnitude of k-space, phase of k-space, and the reconstructed image are displayed in a 2x2 subplot figure.

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `K_Space_Visualization.m`.
3. Run `K_Space_Visualization.m`.
